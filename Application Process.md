```command
    |
    |--Shops
    |   |-- Index.blade.php         # Index File For All Data
    |   |-- Form.blade.php          # Form Template
    |   |-- Edit.blade.php          # Edit Template (If You Are Not ReUsing Form Template)
    |   |-- Filters.blade.php       # Component Required File
    |--Products
    |   |-- Index.blade.php         # Index File For All Data
    |   |-- Form.blade.php          # Form Template
    |   |-- Edit.blade.php          # Edit Template (If You Are Not ReUsing Form Template)
    |   |-- Filters.blade.php       # Component Required File
```
- Create A File Named **filters.blade.php** in Every Directory.

    @endsection
    @section('canvas-body')
        <!--Your All Filteration Code Goes Here Including Form-->
    @endsection
```

```bash
	@include('Path To Your Filter Template You Just Created')
```
- Your Filter Files Are Ready
##### Configure Base File For Static

- Create CSS Links Inside _<head>_ tag as follows
```console
	<link href="<!--Path To Your Assets Folder-->/uisearch/css/canvas.css" rel="stylesheet">
	<link href="<!--Path To Your Assets Folder-->/uisearch/css/filter-grid.css" rel="stylesheet">

- Your Project Is All Set Up
    ##### Bugs And Fixes
    - When You Submit After Filling The Filter Form , It Your Form Is Not Submiting And Logging You Out , Please Change Your Form Submition Button To Input (type="text")
##### Configure Grid On Top Of Table To Indicate Filters
^You^ ^Can^ ^Only^ ^Use^ ^This^ ^Grid^ ^If^ ^You^ ^Are^ ^Using^ **^Get^** ^Method^ ^For^ ^Filteration^
- In Your Project Static Files , Add These Two Variables Anywhere In :root
    - **--filter-outline** : # Any Color For Filter Outline
    - **--filter-background** : # Any Collor For Filter Background
- Create A New File Named **filter_grid.blade.php** In Every Directory Containing **filters.blade.php**
- Add The Following Code In The File
```console
@extends('./uisearch/filter_grid_template')
@section('fields')
    @if(!Request::get(<!--Request-->) && <!--All Patterens From Request-->  )
        <div style="padding-right:15px;" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" >
            <div class="position-relative">
                <div>
                    <label class="text-dark" style="font-size:10px;margin-bottom:0px;font-weight:bold;display:inline-block">No Filters Applied</label>
                    | Click <a type="button" style="cursor:pointer;" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" data-bs-target="#filterCanvas" aria-controls="filterCanvas">Here</a> To Apply Filters <i class="fa fa-filter"></i>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    @endif
    @if(Request::get(<!--Request-->) || <!--All Patterens From Request--> )
        <div style="padding-right:15px;" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" >
            <div class="position-relative" style="top:10px">
                <div style="display:inline-block;max-width:250px;" >
                    <span style="display:flex">
                        <a type="button" style="cursor:pointer;display:inline-block;width:55px" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" data-bs-target="#filterCanvas" aria-controls="filterCanvas">
                            EditFilters
                        </a>
                    </span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    @endif
@endsection
```
- Link **filter_grid.blade.php** File In All Of Your Lists And Indexes On Top Of Table Where You Want To Add This Grid As Follows :
```console
    @include(<!--Path To Your Grid Template-->)
```
- Create Grid Tags To Indicate The Applied Filter Head And Value (It Will Be Repeated For All Fields In Your **filters.blade.php** template)
```console
    @if(Request::get(<!--Field-->))
        <div style="padding-right:15px;display:inline-block" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" >
            <div class="position-relative" style="background-color: var(--filter-outline);border-radius:15%;padding:5px">
                <div>
                    <label for="ControllerID" class="text-dark" style="font-size:10px;margin-bottom:0px;font-weight:bold;">Controller</label>
                </div>
                <div class="filter-fields" style="display:inline-block;max-width:250px;" >
                    <?php $dict = <!--Your Data From API-->; ?>
                    @foreach($dict as $data)
                        @if($data-><!--DataID--> == Request::get(<!--Field-->))
                            {{ $data-><!--DataValue--> }}
                            <input type="text" name="<!--FieldID-->" hidden>
                        @endif
                    @endforeach
                </div>
                <span onclick="<!--FieldID-->" class="position-absolute filter-remove-btn">
                    <span class="fa fa-times-circle" style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="removeFilter(<!--FieldID-->)"></span>
                </span>
            </div>
        </div>
    @endif
```
- Please Note **ALL NAMES SHOULD BE SAME AS WRITEN** eg:(replace all field IDs with Your Field ID) Because These Are Case Sensitive
- Save The File And Reload The Project , Everything Should Be Working
##### Indicating Applied Filters On Table Header
- Open Your Index Template And Identify The Table Headers Which Are Includen In Filters
- Give Their **th** Or **td** Two New Attributes As Follows :
```console
    <td data-id="<!--Data ID From API-->" url-id="<!--ID In URL-->"><!--Field Name--></td>
```
- After Doing That , Opem Your App And Refresh The Page And Apply Some Filters , You Should See A New Grid On Top Of The Table With Indication Of Applied Filters And Table Headers Had Changed Their Color.
- Hover On Any Table Header And You Will See A Tooltip With Name Of Applied Filters.
